My favorite radio is Radio Deejay and I would like to listen its content while I run. The radio offers a live streaming, the podcasts of every program as well as several webradios streaming 24h/7. The iPhone app give access to these contents so I wondered if they have a back-end API available for development. It comes out that the app uses a server that provides JOSNs for each show and it is quite easy to access, then the only missing part to have the radio on the Apple Watch was to write an interface for their API. Well, I did it.

The app is very simple: the main interfaces has three tabs, one for the Lives (Radio or Deejay TV), the list of Podcasts and the Webradios. The live and webradios play directly the contents when they are clicked, while the Podcast opens a new screen with the latest podcasts available for that show and the list of episodes.

The audio player (except for the Video of Deejay TV) works in background so it is possible to listen the contents without blocking the watch on the application.

The contents of the application as well as the logo, images, brands etc. are owned by Elemedia S.p.A., GEDI, EXOR and the development of this app does not want ito infringe any copyright. I will try to contact these groups to have the authorization to publish the application on the App Store, I am also available to give the code to them for free to have an official App for the Apple Watch.
